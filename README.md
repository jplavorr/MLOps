Welcome to my GitHub repository dedicated to MLOps! This project is an open-source initiative that aims to provide a hands-on learning experience for anyone interested in the emerging field of Machine Learning Operations, or MLOps.

This repository is designed to showcase best practices for integrating Machine Learning (ML) systems into production environments. It covers a wide array of topics from data versioning, reproducibility in ML, automated testing, continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD), model monitoring, and more.

One of the key aspects of this project is the practical implementation of continuous integration (CI) in both Software as a Service (SaaS) environments and ML systems. CI is a crucial practice in MLOps, ensuring the seamless integration of code changes, facilitating automated testing, and enhancing code quality and consistency.
